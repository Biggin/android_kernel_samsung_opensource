The stock kernel sources for the Galaxy S6, **"US Cellular"** variant with firmware version __G920R4TYU4DQD3__.

This is my __first__ device that I'm contributing towards, as such I'm learning as I go.
That makes this repo, **VERY MUCH A WIP**

I __WILL__ be force pushing pretty often, I'd assume and I'll also be 'borrowing' a LOT of code from other Android(R)
enthusiasts/programmers who actually know __WTF__ they're doing!

My plans/goals include customized __EVERYTHING__, if possible!
---
1) Pitch Black Recovery Project is already compiled, tested and released to the wild!
2) Custom Kernel is my next endeavor, hence this repo..."Now accepting recommendations for awesome kernel names!"
3) Some custom ROM support for this model! This variant and the Sprint(SM-G920P) don't have the support that the other models do and I want to change that and bring some custom fun stuff to our models!
4) Additional recovery projects 'RedWolf, OrangeFox, Pterodon, SkyHawk & Batik' eventually! I've got SkyHawk & OrangeFox built but have'nt had time to test either
so I don't even know if they'll boot or what...I do know that OrangeFox was giving me a LOT of problems when compiling, if you want to test out some recoveries hit me up and I'll link you some files!
